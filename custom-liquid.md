# Custom Liquid

The **Custom Liquid** section allows advanced users to inject their own Liquid code directly into the theme.

* Add custom HTML or Liquid code. Useful for app snippets or advanced customization.
* One of its biggest advantages is **preservation across theme updates** — custom Liquid code remains intact during migrations, making it a safe way for merchants to customize without disrupting the upgrade path.
* Perfect for small enhancements without developer intervention.
