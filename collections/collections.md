# Collections

Collections in Shopify allow you to group products into categories or themes, making it easier for customers to browse your store and find related items.

For example, you can create collections like **"Summer Clothing," "Best Sellers," or "On Sale.**

### **Types of Collections in Shopify** <a href="#types-of-collections-in-shopify" id="types-of-collections-in-shopify"></a>

### **Manual Collections**:

* A **Manual Collection** requires you to **individually add products** to the collection.
* It gives **full control** over which products appear.

> **success:** 
1. **Go to** Shopify Admin > **Products > Collections**.
2. Click **Add Collection**.
3. Enter a **Title** and **Description**.
4. Under **Collection Type**, select **Manual**.
5. Click **Save** and then manually add products.


#### **Best Use Cases:**

* **Seasonal or Limited-Time Collections** (e.g., Holiday Specials).
* **Curated Product Lists** (e.g., Staff Picks, Best Sellers).
* **Exclusive or VIP Products** that require manual selection.

#### **Smart Collections**:

* An **Automated Collection** uses **rules and conditions** to dynamically add products.
* Products that match the set conditions are **automatically included** in the collection.
